## What's this about?

We'd like to help you with your tech project.  It might be a website, an
app, or an open data API -- but we'll call it "the project" for short.
Maybe we can help you build it, or open source it, or find volunteers to
work on it.  But first, we have to understand what you already have in
place.

You probably want your chief techie, or whoever built the existing
project, to answer this.

There are a lot of questions here, and they might seem daunting, but if
you don't know the answer or don't have something, just say "no" or "I
don't know".  This will help us identify areas where we can help, which
is what we're here for!
