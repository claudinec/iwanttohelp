iwanttohelp
===========

I want to help you with your project, probably open sourcing it or
building a volunteer developer community.  These resources will help us
work together.

## What's this about?

Sometimes I approach organisations and try to help them.  Sometimes
other people approach orgs I'm involved in and try to help us.  Usually
we're trying to help the orgs with one or more of:

* building or improving a tech platform or product
* open sourcing their software
* open licensing their data or other materials
* building a volunteer community around their technology
* changing the world in wonderful ways through techie magic

That all sounds ace, but it's a bit vague.  Exactly how will this work?
Who'll be involved?  What will it cost (if anything)?  What
organisational support will be needed?

These resources help to have these conversations.  The main thing is the
[firstcontact.md]("first contact" questionaire), which allows the
"helper" to understand what help is actually wanted or needed, and how
they might be able to work with the helpee.

## Who am I?

I'm an open source developer who's got about 15 years' experience
contributing to and leading open source projects and tech communities,
both in volunteer roles and as an employee of a variety of
companies (ranging from small startups to publicly traded tech
companies, including Google).

I am also involved in a range of volunteer and activist communities
inside and outside of tech.  I was one of the founding advisors for [The
Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/), which supports and promotes
women's involvement in open technology and culture.

I have spoken at (and several times keynoted at) dozens of tech
conferences, about subjects like getting more people involved in open
source, how open source ties into broader social movements or can solve
social problems, best practices for open source software development,
and the future of open data.

My current main project is [http://growstuff.org/](Growstuff), an open
source/open data project for food-growers, which has had 30+ developers
in its first year, from a wide range of programming backgrounds and
diverse demographics.  Check out our
[http://github.com/Growstuff/growstuff](github repo) or our
[http://wiki.growstuff.org](wiki) to see how the project operates.  You
may also like to view [http://github.com/Skud](my github profile) to get
a sense of my experience and contributions.

## Critiquing/improving/contributing

Please do!  This is going to be pretty rough at first, and I would love
help and advice from anyone who has experience in these things.

You can make suggestions by raising a github issue ticket, or through a
pull request.
